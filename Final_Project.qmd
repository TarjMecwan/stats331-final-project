## Dependencies

To start, we need to load the `tidyverse` and `knitr` packages into RStudio.

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

## Datasets

Next, we will read in our datasets!

```{r}
#| message: false

poverty <- read_csv("data/poverty.csv")
inflation <- read_csv("data/inflation.csv")
```

Let's examine the `poverty.csv` dataset.

```{r}
head(poverty) |> 
  kable()
```

Here's what the `inflation.csv` dataset looks like.

```{r}
head(inflation) |> 
  kable()
```

**TODO**: Detailed data and variable description. (Rachel)

-   Summarize the poverty dataset (Extreme Poverty Rate, less than \$2.15/day)

-   Summarze the inflation dataset (Inflation, annual %)

The poverty dataset contains information on the poverty rate for countries over time. Each country represents one observation and each column represents one year. The inflation dataset contains information on the inflation rate for countries over time. Similar to the poverty dataset, each country represents one observation and each column represents one year. The poverty dataset contains information on the years 1800 to 2100 while the inflation dataset only contains information on the years 1961 to 2023. Both datasets contain numerous NA values.

## Data Cleaning Process

Data cleaning is a crucial step in ensuring that our analysis is based on accurate and meaningful data. Since the datasets from Gapminder contain economic indicators recorded across multiple years for different countries, we followed a structured cleaning process to prepare our data for analysis. Below, we outline the key steps and the rationale behind each decision.

#### 1. Filtering Overlapping Years

The original datasets contained economic data spanning different time periods, with some variables recorded in years that were not present in the other dataset. To maintain consistency, we filtered both datasets to include only the overlapping years, **1961 to 2023**. This step ensures that we are analyzing the relationship between extreme poverty rates and inflation rates over a common time period without introducing missing values due to mismatched years.

```{r}
# Filter the datasets to include only the overlapping years (1961 to 2023):

inflation_filtered <- inflation |>
  select(country, `1961`:`2023`)

poverty_filtered <- poverty |>
  select(country, `1961`:`2023`)

```

#### 2. Reshaping the Data: Pivoting Longer

The datasets were structured in a wide format, where each year was a separate column. For ease of analysis and visualization, we transformed them into a long format by pivoting the year columns into a single `year` variable. This conversion was necessary to perform operations like merging datasets and running regression models. We also ensured that the `year` column was treated as a numeric variable rather than a character string, enabling proper chronological analysis.

```{r}
# 1.2 Pivoting Longer
# Pivot the year columns to a single column in both datasets

inflation_long <- inflation_filtered |>
  pivot_longer(cols = `1961`:`2023`, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "inflation_rate") |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

poverty_long <- poverty_filtered |>
  pivot_longer(cols = `1961`:`2023`, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "poverty_rate") |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

```

#### 3. Merging the Datasets

After reshaping, we joined the two datasets on the common columns: `country` and `year`. Given that some countries may have missing data for either variable, we chose an inner join to retain only the observations that exist in both datasets. This approach minimizes the risk of bias in our analysis by ensuring that each `country-year` pair has both poverty and inflation data available.

```{r}
# 1.3 Joining Datasets
# Join the datasets on country and year

poverty_inflation_data <- inflation_long |>
  inner_join(poverty_long, by = c("country", "year"))

```

#### 4. Handling Missing Values

Economic data often contains missing values due to reporting inconsistencies or gaps in data collection. To address this, we dropped rows with missing values after merging the datasets. While other imputation techniques (such as mean or median substitution) could have been used, we opted for deletion to maintain the integrity of our statistical analysis and avoid introducing artificial patterns.

```{r}
# Handle missing values

poverty_inflation_data <- poverty_inflation_data |>
  drop_na()

```

#### 5. Final Dataset Verification

After completing these steps, we inspected the cleaned dataset to confirm that:

-   All countries and years were correctly aligned.

-   No extraneous variables remained.

-   The dataset was free of missing values.

```{r}
head(poverty_inflation_data) |>
  kable()
```

**TODO**: Detailed data and variable description. (Rachel)

-   Summarize the joined dataset

## Hypothesis

We hypothesize that there will be a nonlinear relationship between inflation rates and poverty rates in the world. Intuitively, frequent fluctuations in inflation rates will be associated with higher poverty rates, as economic instability disproportionately affects people of lower incomes. Additionally, we hypothesize there will be regional or country-specific patterns because economic structures, government policies, and external factors such as tariffs and diplomatic conflict will effect the relationship between inflation and poverty differs across global regions.
