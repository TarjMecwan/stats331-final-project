# Exploring Relationships Between Extreme Poverty Rates and Inflation Rates in the World

In this analysis, we explore the relationships between extreme poverty rates and inflation rates 
around the world through a series of data visualizations, linear regression models, and simulations. 
We use data from the Poverty and Inequality Platform of [The World Bank](https://pip.worldbank.org/home) 
and [The World Bank Group](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.DEFL.KD.ZG),
specifically the "Extreme Poverty Rate, less than \$2.15/day" and "Inflation, annual %" data sets curated by 
[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).

### Package Dependencies and Tech Stack

For this project, we use the `tidyverse`, `knitr`, `viridis`, `kableExtra`, `broom` and `bibtex` packages in RStudio. 
Our reproducible R code is written in a Quarto document and hosted on GitHub in this repository.
