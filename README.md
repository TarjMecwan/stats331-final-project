# Exploring Relationships Between Extreme Poverty Rates and Inflation Rates in the World

In this analysis, we will explore the relationships between extreme poverty rates 
and inflation rates around the World. We will be using the 
`Extreme Poverty Rate, less than $2.15/day` and `Inflation, annual %` data sets, 
downloaded as `poverty.csv` and `inflation.csv` respectively, 
from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).

### Dependencies

For this project, we use the `tidyverse` and `knitr` packages in RStudio. Our code
is written in a Quarto document and hosted on GitHub.
